### Final Commentary on My Computer
1. This computer is 50% of my life because of how much I love it. I've had this computer for only 1-2 years so far but at the end of the day, it feels like I've known this computer for a very long time. I am in love with this computer and how it works since the day I recieved it .

2. My computer has been very fast with loading and running programmes. The reason being, it has 16 GB worth of RAM which if there is more of it, the faster a program will run and the more variety of programmes you can run as well. With that, I have had a lot of space with the 1 TB storage to download more things to use. The operating system that I have also works with the speed of the computer as it is the latest OS available and a new version will be released every now and again. However, the increased speed from the RAM and extra space from the Storage are problematic sometimes to me just because I can get ahead of myself and eventually reach a wall with what my computer can do but that's about it from what I've seen so far.

3.  Finally, for those who are curious, this is my computer. (Please pay no mind to the dirtiness because it's regularly cleaned by myself):
